They're like eyesores to police,39,Revival,4,Untouchable
Talk to you like just a piece of trash,40,Revival,4,Untouchable

"We're applying, but McDonald's",56,Revival,4,Untouchable
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire,57,Revival,4,Untouchable
So how can we have higher standards?,58,Revival,4,Untouchable
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter,59,Revival,4,Untouchable
We fight back with violence but acts like that are,60,Revival,4,Untouchable
Black eyes on the movement,61,Revival,4,Untouchable
Which makes black lives madder,62,Revival,4,Untouchable
At cops and cops madder,63,Revival,4,Untouchable
That's why it's at a stalemate,64,Revival,4,Untouchable
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops,65,Revival,4,Untouchable

A subconscious racist,76,Revival,4,Untouchable

"'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area",78,Revival,4,Untouchable
"Separated us, Section-Eight'd us",79,Revival,4,Untouchable
When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us,80,Revival,4,Untouchable

"Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz",82,Revival,4,Untouchable
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?,83,Revival,4,Untouchable
We just want a safe environment for our kids,84,Revival,4,Untouchable
But can’t escape the sirens,85,Revival,4,Untouchable
Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in,86,Revival,4,Untouchable
The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in,87,Revival,4,Untouchable
"The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence",88,Revival,4,Untouchable
And we’re trapped in these racial biases,89,Revival,4,Untouchable
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise,90,Revival,4,Untouchable
Every time we see a devil’s face,91,Revival,4,Untouchable
"Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my",92,Revival,4,Untouchable

"Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?",100,Revival,4,Untouchable
"And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics",101,Revival,4,Untouchable
"Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black",102,Revival,4,Untouchable
You better be strapped with a derringer,103,Revival,4,Untouchable
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers,104,Revival,4,Untouchable
'Cause no one oversees these cops and,105,Revival,4,Untouchable
All we see is 'em beat charges,106,Revival,4,Untouchable
"We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off",107,Revival,4,Untouchable
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings,108,Revival,4,Untouchable
"Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress",109,Revival,4,Untouchable
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance,110,Revival,4,Untouchable
If you try to slander the flag but,111,Revival,4,Untouchable
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb,112,Revival,4,Untouchable
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum,113,Revival,4,Untouchable
If you don't stand for the national anthem,114,Revival,4,Untouchable
"We raise it, you better praise it",115,Revival,4,Untouchable
"Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll",116,Revival,4,Untouchable
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield,117,Revival,4,Untouchable
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville,118,Revival,4,Untouchable
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field,119,Revival,4,Untouchable
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals,120,Revival,4,Untouchable
That had its Natives killed,121,Revival,4,Untouchable

She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you,15,Recovery,8,Seduction
What you expect her to do?,16,Recovery,8,Seduction
How you expect her to act in the sack when she's closin' her eyes,17,Recovery,8,Seduction
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track?,18,Recovery,8,Seduction
She's sittin' there gettin' liquored up at the bar,19,Recovery,8,Seduction
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you,20,Recovery,8,Seduction
Than to count the things that are,21,Recovery,8,Seduction
There's a seven-disc CD changer in her car,22,Recovery,8,Seduction

"You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy",34,Recovery,8,Seduction
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth,35,Recovery,8,Seduction
"You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank, boy",36,Recovery,8,Seduction
"But you got a hard-on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?",37,Recovery,8,Seduction
"It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it",38,Recovery,8,Seduction
It's like we're playin' lyrical tug of war with your ear,39,Recovery,8,Seduction

Am I tryin' to show how? Let me slow it down some,48,Recovery,8,Seduction
It's still gonna be a blow-out,49,Recovery,8,Seduction
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album,50,Recovery,8,Seduction
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see,51,Recovery,8,Seduction
"If you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me",52,Recovery,8,Seduction
"Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit?",53,Recovery,8,Seduction
You think you killin' them syllables? Quit,54,Recovery,8,Seduction
"Playin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with",55,Recovery,8,Seduction
They call me Fire Marshall: I shut the shit down,56,Recovery,8,Seduction
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round,57,Recovery,8,Seduction
I am also the opposite of what you are like,58,Recovery,8,Seduction
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic,59,Recovery,8,Seduction
I am awesome and you are just awe-struck,60,Recovery,8,Seduction
"She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck",61,Recovery,8,Seduction

"It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress",3,Recovery,10,Space Bound
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust,4,Recovery,10,Space Bound

"It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go",10,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so",11,Recovery,10,Space Bound
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes,12,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?",13,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this",14,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like",15,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"Tryin' to start over, I got a hole in my heart",16,Recovery,10,Space Bound
But some kind of emotional roller coaster,17,Recovery,10,Space Bound
Is something I won't go on,18,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"So you toy with my emotions, so it's over",19,Recovery,10,Space Bound
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya,20,Recovery,10,Space Bound

"I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes",23,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength",24,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths",25,Recovery,10,Space Bound
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's,26,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same",27,Recovery,10,Space Bound
You want 'em when they don't want you,28,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"Soon as they do, feelings change",29,Recovery,10,Space Bound
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate,30,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate",31,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?",32,Recovery,10,Space Bound
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face,33,Recovery,10,Space Bound
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open,34,Recovery,10,Space Bound

"'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason",43,Recovery,10,Space Bound
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live,44,Recovery,10,Space Bound
Tears stream down both of my cheeks,45,Recovery,10,Space Bound
Now I let you go and just give,46,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this",47,Recovery,10,Space Bound
And I would've done anything for you,48,Recovery,10,Space Bound
To show you how much I adored you,49,Recovery,10,Space Bound
"But it's over now, it's too late to save our love",50,Recovery,10,Space Bound

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made,1,Recovery,12,25 To Life
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed,2,Recovery,12,25 To Life

"Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain",4,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"Bitch, you took me for granted",5,Recovery,12,25 To Life
Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet,6,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it, now my respect, I demand it",7,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"I'ma take control of this relationship, command it",8,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it",9,Recovery,12,25 To Life
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me,10,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"So you better hear me out, this much you owe me",11,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed",12,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?",13,Recovery,12,25 To Life

I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness,17,Recovery,12,25 To Life
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left,18,Recovery,12,25 To Life
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step,19,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath",20,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"You know what you've done, no need to go in-depth",21,Recovery,12,25 To Life
I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left,22,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"I laughed while you wept, how's it feel now?",23,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me",24,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set",25,Recovery,12,25 To Life
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept,26,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"It's unfortunate, but it's…",27,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh",28,Recovery,12,25 To Life
‘Cause that ain't good enough,29,Recovery,12,25 To Life
You expect me to fold myself in half 'til I snap,30,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap",31,Recovery,12,25 To Life
How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that,32,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"Don't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?",33,Recovery,12,25 To Life
Jealous when I spend time with the girls,34,Recovery,12,25 To Life
"Why I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know",35,Recovery,12,25 To Life
But tonight I'm serving you with papers,36,Recovery,12,25 To Life
I'm divorcing you – go marry someone else and make 'em famous!,37,Recovery,12,25 To Life
And take away their freedom like you did to me,38,Recovery,12,25 To Life

As I fall deeper into a manic state,1,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
I'm a prime candidate for the gene,2,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
To receive the drug addict trait,3,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate,4,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate,5,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Start off with the NyQuil, like, ""I think I'll just have a taste""",6,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate,7,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
To a harder prescription drug called Valium,8,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Like, ""yeah, that's great""",9,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight,10,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate,11,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak,12,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
And you'd think that with all I have at stake,13,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Look at my daughter's face,14,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"""Mommy, something is wrong with Dad I think",15,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me",16,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me,17,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos,18,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"And he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 Musketeers in the rear seat""",19,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know",20,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Feels like I been down this road before,21,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu

"I wanna get away from this place, I do",25,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu

Who's the mastermind behind that little line?,36,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind",37,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
To have another half a glass of wine,38,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Sounds asinine, yeah, I know",39,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
But I never had no problem with alcohol,40,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, I'm 'bout to fall",41,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"I miss the couch and down I go, lookin' like a bouncy ball",42,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Shit must've knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all,43,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Wow, what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?",44,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Man, fuck, am I hungover, and goddamn, I got a headache",45,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?",46,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"All systems ready for take off, please stand by",47,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu

"But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know",54,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
That's a lie' cause I don't,55,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"And why, I just don't know",56,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then (Ahhh!)",57,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Couple of weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high",58,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by",59,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die,60,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Oh yeah, there's an excuse; you lose Proof, so you use",61,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through",62,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu

"Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse",65,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"""Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax""",66,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu

"I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps",68,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see",69,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?",70,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep,71,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Okay, so now ya see the reason how come he",72,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu

"'Cause that Christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?",75,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"It was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?",76,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?,77,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR",78,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"Great places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie",79,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"I'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby; good night, Alaina!",80,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door,81,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
And wake up in an ambulance,82,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
"They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn",83,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu

"'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know",91,Relapse,16,Déjà Vu
Lately I've been hard to reach,1,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I've been too long on my own,2,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Everybody has a private world,3,Relapse,17,Beautiful

Are you calling me?,5,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Are you trying to get through?,6,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Are you reaching out for me?,7,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Then I'm reaching out for you,8,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I'm just so fuckin' depressed,9,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I just can't seem to get out this slump,10,Relapse,17,Beautiful
If I could just get over this hump,11,Relapse,17,Beautiful
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump,12,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"I took my bruises, took my lumps",13,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Fell down and I got right back up,14,Relapse,17,Beautiful
But I need that spark to get psyched back up,15,Relapse,17,Beautiful
In order for me to pick the mic back up,16,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I don't know how or why or when,17,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I ended up in this position I'm in,18,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I'm starting to feel distant again,19,Relapse,17,Beautiful
So I decided just to pick this pen,20,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Up and try to make an attempt to vent,21,Relapse,17,Beautiful
But I just can't admit,22,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap,23,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I need a new outlet,24,Relapse,17,Beautiful
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow,25,Relapse,17,Beautiful
But I just can't sit back and wallow,26,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:",27,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I'll be one tough act to follow,28,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow",29,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"Here today, gone tomorrow",30,Relapse,17,Beautiful
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—,31,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"In my shoes, just to see",32,Relapse,17,Beautiful
What it's like to be me,33,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"I'll be you, let's trade shoes",34,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Just to see what it'd be like to,35,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"Feel your pain, you feel mine",36,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Go inside each other's minds,37,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Just to see what we find,38,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Look at shit through each other's eyes,39,Relapse,17,Beautiful
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful,40,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you",41,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful,42,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you",43,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor,44,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Everything's so tense and gloom,45,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature,46,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"Of the room, just as soon as",47,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"I walk in, it's like all eyes on me",48,Relapse,17,Beautiful
So I try to avoid any eye contact,49,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door",50,Relapse,17,Beautiful
For conversation like I want that,51,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I'm not lookin' for extra attention,52,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I just wanna be just like you,53,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Blend in with the rest of the room,54,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom,55,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I don't need no fuckin' man servant,56,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass,57,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Laugh at every single joke I crack,58,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!",59,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"Marshall, you're so funny, man",60,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"You should be a comedian, goddamn!""",61,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Unfortunately I am,62,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I just hide behind the tears of a clown,63,Relapse,17,Beautiful
So why don't you all sit down?,64,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell,65,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes",66,Relapse,17,Beautiful
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—,67,Relapse,17,Beautiful

What it's like to be me,69,Relapse,17,Beautiful

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful,78,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you",79,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Nobody asked for life to deal us,80,Relapse,17,Beautiful
With these bullshit hands we're dealt,81,Relapse,17,Beautiful
We gotta take these cards ourselves,82,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"And flip 'em, don't expect no help",83,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned",84,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in,85,Relapse,17,Beautiful
And get up and get my own,86,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags,87,Relapse,17,Beautiful
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed,88,Relapse,17,Beautiful
For a dad to show up who never did,89,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went",90,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I dreamed of being that cool kid,91,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Even if it meant acting stupid,92,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Aunt Edna always told me:,93,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""",94,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there",95,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this",96,Relapse,17,Beautiful
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old,97,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I learned my lesson then,98,Relapse,17,Beautiful
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo',99,Relapse,17,Beautiful
But I already told you my whole life story,100,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Not just based on my description,101,Relapse,17,Beautiful
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin',102,Relapse,17,Beautiful
It's probably 110% different,103,Relapse,17,Beautiful
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least,104,Relapse,17,Beautiful
What size you wear? I wear 10's,105,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Let's see if you can fit your feet—,106,Relapse,17,Beautiful

Are you reaching out for me?,125,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Then I'm reaching out for you,126,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"Yeah, to my babies: stay strong",127,Relapse,17,Beautiful
Daddy'll be home soon,128,Relapse,17,Beautiful
And to the rest of the world: God gave you them shoes to fit you,129,Relapse,17,Beautiful
"So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man",130,Relapse,17,Beautiful

Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus,13,Relapse,18,Crack a Bottle

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks,15,Relapse,18,Crack a Bottle

The only way that I am able to stay so stable,51,Encore,17,Crazy in Love
Is you're the legs to my table,52,Encore,17,Crazy in Love
If you were to break I'd fall on my face,53,Encore,17,Crazy in Love
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much,54,Encore,17,Crazy in Love
